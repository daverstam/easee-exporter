## Easee Home exporter for Prometheus

Currently this exporter only fetches the Equalizer metrics, I made this mainly to monitor my total power usage however I (or someone else) will probably add more metrics in the future.

To get this running you need Prometheus and Python. I'm running my setup on an old Raspberry Pi with Debian and it works fine and dandy.
